Exercise 32: Hangman
In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, the player 
only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.
Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already 
guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
